# Welcome to **Course Day 4!**

Today’s theme: **Open Science, Sharing, and Project Quality**  
You’ll learn to **license**, **version**, **publish**, and **reflect** on your code!

## 🛠️ Activity 1: **Create a License & a Version Release**

> 📚 **Goal:** License your project and create a formal version for sharing.

### 📝 Steps

1. **Create a License File**
   - In your **fork** of the course repository, create a new file:  
     `LICENSE.md`
   - Choose a license that fits your project (e.g., MIT, BSD, GPL).  
     👉 Tip: [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

2. **Commit Your License**
   - Write a clear commit message, e.g.,  
     `"Add MIT License"`

3. **Create a Version Release**
   - Go to your repo ➔ **Releases** ➔ **Draft a new release**.
   - Tag your release (e.g., `v0.1.0`) under "Choose your tag".
   - Add a short title (for example, "Initial Release" ) and description for your release.

   > Attention: You can publish your repository, but once published, a record on Zenodo CANNOT BE RELEASED (only updated/changed). If you don't want your test repo to show up on your Zenodo, don't hit publish, but delete the draft.

✅ **Result:** Your project now has a license **and** an official version release!

<summary>Activity 2 -Archive Your Project and Create a DOI (Zenodo)</summary>

## 🌍 Activity 2: **Archive Your Project and Create a DOI (Zenodo)**

> 🏛️ **Goal:** Make your project permanently citable.

For this task, you will have tp create a **New Repository** on Github.

# 📝 Steps

### 1. **Create a Zenodo Account**

- Go to [https://zenodo.org/](https://zenodo.org/)
- Click **Sign In** (you can use GitHub or ORCID)
- Complete your profile for proper citation (name, affiliation, email)

---

### 2. **Link Zenodo to Your GitHub Repository**

- Under your profile, go to the **GitHub tab** in Zenodo:  
  [https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/)
- Click **Connect GitHub**
- Authorize Zenodo on GitHub
- Your Github repositories should appear
- Toggle **ON** for the repository you want Zenodo to archive

> Careful: Once you create a release in a monitored repository, it will be archived on Zenodo, and will show up on your record. If you don't want the test repo to be (permanently) archived, stop here.
You can use the rest of the time to explore repositories on Zenodo.

### 3. **Go back to Github and make a new GitHub Release** (most likely Zenodo will not recognize your previous one)

- On GitHub, go to your repository ➔ **Releases** ➔ **Draft a new release**
- Add:
  - **Tag** (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
  - **Title** (e.g., `Version 1.0.0`)
  - **Changelog** or release notes (optional)

**A DOI** will be created

- Copy the DOI in Markdown format and go back to Github. Add the DOI to the Readme. Commit.

<summary>Activity 3 - Group work</summary>

## 🤝 Activity 3: **Group Work – What Makes a Good Code Project?**

> 🧠 **Goal:** Reflect together on what makes software truly great.

### 📝 Steps

- **Form small groups** (3–6 people).

- One person creates a new Github repository. The other members of the group fork it.

- Brainstorm and create a **Checklist** for:

  > _"What makes a good code project?"_

💬 **The list could include items such as:**

- Github/Gitlab
- folder structure and naming
- Documentation quality
- Code structure and readability
- Testing and validation
- Licensing and citation
- Reusability and modularity
- Community contributions (issues, pull requests)
- Automation (Makefiles, CI/CD)

⚡ **Question:**  
> Did we miss anything important during the course?

**Future**

- What would you like to learn more about?

Split the work. Work collaboratively on the Checklist. Commit and make pull requests to the main repository.

🎤 **Be ready to share your checklist with the full group!**
